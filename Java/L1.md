## Java cross-platform

        Java compiles source code ```.java``` files into ```.class``` files, and put them into virtual machine to run, which means Java is a mixed language, both compiled form and interpret form.

        And it has several key components:

>- **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)**: the place that truely running the codes.

>- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: comprises JVM, core-class-repo (核心类库) and development tools, e.g. javac, a tool for compile, jdb, a tool for debug and so forth.

>- **Java Runtime Environment (JRE)**: if JRE is installed, the code can running. It includes JVM, core-class-repo, and running tools.

        In conlusion, JDK includes JRE, while JRE include JVM. That's is, JDK > JRE > JVM

## **Java annotation**

- Using ```//```, ```/* ... */``` to add annotations of single line and multiple line, respectively. 
- And ```//* */```, to add file documentation.

## **计算机中的计算**

> 采用补码进行计算，比如1Byte, 8bit, 范围为-128~127, 即 $ [2^{-n}, 2^{n-1}]  $ <br>

## **Memory**
