## 1.Variables
</font>

> such as ``` int a = 10```. the structure likes ```dataType variable_name = value```

    Some basic operators also bridges variables, including arithmetic, logic, and etc.

Some specials should be noted:

> ```+```  **operation**

- In ```+``` operation, a ```int``` type data adds a ```double``` type data will finally gets a ```double``` type. The datatype gets promoted implicitly. Besides, the type ```byte``` ```char``` ```short``` will firstly be converted into ```int``` type defaultly when they are taken into calculation.

- The ```+``` operator also function in ```string``` type, which connects two strings.

- When the data with datatype ```char``` gets added, the rules follow the rule 1., and map the char into ASCll value.

> ```&&,||,&,|``` logical operation

- It should be noted that the ```&``` and ```|``` and the double form of them both represents "and" and "or", respectively. However, the ```&&``` and ```||``` will takes the left connected equation firstly. For ```a && b```, if the ```a``` is ```false```, the ```b``` wont get judged, the whole term will be false. Similarly, if ```a || b```, the a is true, the whole term will be true.

## 2.Class

> All classes can be put into the same directory, that is, package. And the class name in the directory should keey the same with its original name in source code.
